# Data205---2025-1

This is my capstone project for the class took in spring 2025 at Montgomery College. The project is a partnership between the City of Rockville and the college. The city of rockville gained a grant from the federal government to build a pedestrian bridge crossing the metro tracks in the area of twinbrook station. The project presented by them was, a explanation on the better way/location to put the bridge on. And more exploration on the situation the benefits it can bring.

# Exploring the problem: urbanization in the USA

Has we can see 

# The aaproach
To help the city decide and improve, the team decided on creating a consultation report wich will include a data analises on the time people living in the twinbroke area take to comute to general interrest points arroung the are. 

# Data screppling

There were too many problems, budgetwise and toolwise to create the project data set. 

# Exploring periferal data

Too many periferal data and information exist on the topic, and the structure of the project, unfortunaly can not handle it all. A futher recomendation is for the city of Rockville to explore more about it all. 

Looking at the area: car purpuse area vs people perpuse area
Land is expensive, and it is getting more and more expensive. 

# Exploring periferal information

Other verry important and interresting complementary information consist of urbanization exemples arround the world 

# Report

The final Report presented to the city is available in this link: 

# A forseable future, a final pledge, a potencial in front of us.

The world is not changing, because by saying it we implicate that once he was somehow still. Witch I know it has been contested in the last years. But the world is following its course of contineous change and adaptation, and now more then ever the world is less and less encouraged to follow status quo or structures of power and more and more inclined into smart and inovative transformation. Let us not think that great change is impossible, and good change is to dificult, let us know that it takes our own efforts to see great futures. This project is to me the start to many possible futures, it is not about the people bridge over the twinbrook tracks, it is about urbanization, it is about the people that live here and how we use our limited land, for the poeple, or despite it.

These futures range from a continuity of the past and the abcence of the bridge, passing to simply the bridge, to my favorite a development program to the region. Of shops, servisses, restaurants and many more not disigned the cars that pass by, but for the people that live there, now accesable by the bridge, possibly more then one.
